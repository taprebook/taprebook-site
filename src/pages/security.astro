      <h2>Hosting &amp; infrastructure</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Reputable cloud providers</strong> with physical, network, and environmental safeguards.</li>
        <li><strong>Segregated environments</strong> for development, staging, and production.</li>
        <li><strong>Hardened defaults</strong>: least-privilege service accounts, locked-down inbound access.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data protection</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Encryption in transit</strong> via TLS for data moving between clients, services, and providers.</li>
        <li><strong>Encryption at rest</strong> for stored data, including backups and logs where applicable.</li>
        <li><strong>Key management</strong> handled by the underlying cloud KMS with rotation policies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Access &amp; authentication</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>MFA required</strong> for administrative access.</li>
        <li><strong>Role-based access control (RBAC)</strong> with least-privilege permissions.</li>
        <li><strong>Periodic reviews</strong> of access (joiner/mover/leaver process).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Application security</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dependency management</strong> and automated vulnerability scanning.</li>
        <li><strong>Change management</strong> with code review and CI/CD checks for critical paths.</li>
        <li><strong>Secrets management</strong> via environment stores (no secrets committed to source).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Privacy &amp; compliance</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data minimization</strong>—we process only what’s needed to operate your configured flows.</li>
        <li><strong>Regional considerations</strong> and appropriate safeguards for international transfers.</li>
        <li>See our <a href="/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a> for details on data types, rights, and retention.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Retention &amp; deletion</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Operational records</strong> retained only as long as needed for service delivery and legal obligations.</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion on request</strong> available for applicable data subject requests.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Backups &amp; continuity</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Regular backups</strong> for key data stores with restore testing.</li>
        <li><strong>Disaster recovery</strong> procedures and runbooks for major incidents.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Incident response</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Documented IR plan</strong> with triage, containment, remediation, and post-incident review.</li>
        <li><strong>Customer communication</strong> for incidents that materially affect your data or service.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Subprocessors</h2>
      <p>
        We work with select service providers (e.g., WhatsApp BSPs, hosting, analytics) to deliver TapRebook. A current
        list is available on request and will be published on our website as it evolves.
      </p>
