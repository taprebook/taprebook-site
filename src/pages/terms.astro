      <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>
        By accessing or using TapRebook (the “Service”), you agree to these Terms of Service (“Terms”).
        If you use the Service on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization.
        If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>Use of Service &amp; WhatsApp/BSP Compliance</h2>
      <p>
        You must comply with all applicable laws and Meta/WhatsApp policies, including Business Messaging Policies,
        template rules, and your BSP’s terms. You are solely responsible for the accuracy and lawfulness of your message
        content and recipients. We may suspend or block messaging that appears non-compliant or harmful.
      </p>

      <h2>Consent, Opt-in, and Opt-out</h2>
      <p>
        You warrant that every recipient has provided valid consent to receive messages and that you will promptly honor
        opt-out requests. You are responsible for choosing the correct WhatsApp template categories (e.g., Utility,
        Authentication, Marketing) and for refraining from promotional copy in non-marketing templates.
      </p>

      <h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>No spam or unlawful, misleading, or harmful content.</li>
        <li>No attempts to probe, scan, overload, or disrupt the Service.</li>
        <li>No use for regulated advice (e.g., medical, legal, financial) without appropriate compliance and approvals.</li>
        <li>No infringement of third-party rights, including privacy and intellectual property.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Roles &amp; Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        As between the parties, you are the <strong>data controller</strong> of end-user personal data, and TapRebook acts
        as a <strong>data processor</strong> processing personal data solely to provide the Service and as described in our
        <a href="/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>. A Data Processing Addendum (DPA) is available upon request.
      </p>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect personal data. See
        <a href="/security/">Application &amp; Data Security</a> for an overview of controls.
        You remain responsible for securing your own systems, credentials, and access.
      </p>

      <h2>Availability &amp; Third-Party Dependencies</h2>
      <p>
        Message delivery relies on third parties (BSPs, Meta, telcos, networks) and template approvals. We do not guarantee
        uninterrupted availability, delivery, or approval outcomes. We may apply fair-use rate limits to ensure platform stability.
      </p>

      <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>
        TapRebook owns the Service, software, and platform materials. You retain ownership of your data, trademarks, and content.
        You grant TapRebook a non-exclusive license to process your content and data solely to operate and improve the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>Fees, Taxes, and Refunds</h2>
      <p>
        Unless otherwise stated in an order form, fees are invoiced as agreed and are non-refundable except where required by law.
        You are responsible for applicable taxes. If you later offer self-serve subscriptions, the corresponding plan terms will apply.
      </p>

      <h2>Suspension &amp; Termination</h2>
      <p>
        We may suspend or terminate access for policy violations, non-payment, or risk to the platform. Upon termination you remain
        responsible for accrued fees. Upon request, we will provide reasonable data export assistance for 30 days after termination.
      </p>

      <h2>Indemnification</h2>
      <p>
        You will indemnify and hold TapRebook harmless from claims, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees)
        arising from your content, unlawful messaging, violation of these Terms, or infringement of third-party rights.
      </p>

      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, TapRebook will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential,
        exemplary, or punitive damages, or lost profits or revenues. TapRebook’s aggregate liability under these Terms will not exceed
        the fees you paid to TapRebook in the <strong>12 months</strong> preceding the event giving rise to the claim.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to the Service or Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may modify the Service or these Terms. Material changes will be posted on this page. Your continued use after changes
        become effective constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>Governing Law &amp; Venue</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms are governed by the laws of India. Courts located in Kerala, India (Ernakulam) will have exclusive jurisdiction,
        unless another venue is specified in a signed order form.
      </p>
